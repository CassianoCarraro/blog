Continuing with the topic of DevSecOps, as discussed in the [last post](/blog/my-thoughts-on-devsecops), today I'm sharing a framework that helps organizations systematically improve practices throughout the software development lifecycle. With this framework, we can assess the current maturity level of a team or company and use that insight as a guide for planning improvement actions.

DevSecOps maturity represents an organization's ability to embed security practices into its development and operations processes. Mature DevSecOps organizations integrate security from the very beginning of software development.

## Understanding DevSecOps Maturity

The framework is composed of two main classifications: **dimensions** and **implementation levels**. The dimensions represents areas of software development lifecycle and include the following:
- Build and deployment
- Culture and organization
- Implementation
- Information gathering
- Test and verification

The implementation levels represent the degree of practice adoption ‚Äî starting from basic knowledge and progressing to advanced practices at scale. These levels can be defined as:
1. Basic understanding of security practices
2. Adoption of basic security practices
3. High adoption of security practices
4. Very high adoption of security practices
5. Advanced deployment of security practices at scale.

This framework is based on the high level structure of the [ISO 27001 standard](https://www.iso.org/standard/27001).

## Evaluating the Maturity Model

Create regular cycles with your team to evaluate your DevSecOps maturity. In my experience, the frequency should be somewhat spaced out ‚Äî for example, semiannually or annually. Since we're working on cultural and process improvements, changes and their effects may take time to appear before a practice can truly be considered "ready".

Be cautious when marking practices as "ready". I like to think that if we're not certain a practice is in place, we shouldn't mark it. It's better to make a false negative than a false positive ‚Äî because in the case of a false negative, we'll review the practice again at some point. In contrast, a false positive might lead us to ignore a practice that could significantly improve our development cycle.

One of the strengths of the DSOMM framework is its extensibility. You can [fork the project on GitHub](https://github.com/devsecopsmaturitymodel/DevSecOps-MaturityModel), perform your company's evaluation, and publish it on an internal website or company portal. This promotes transparency of information. You can also add or remove practices according to your organization's specific scope.

## Key Characteristics of Mature DevSecOps Organizations

In my perspective, the following elements lead companies toward a mature DevSecOps implementation:

### üîí Embedded Security
- Security integrated from project modeling
- Security requirements in design phase
- Regulatory laws for data processing addressed from the beginning
- Threat modeling integrated into planning
- Automated security gates in deployment
- Continuous security validation

### ‚öôÔ∏è End-to-End Automation
- Integration of security tools in CI/CD processes
- Continuous security monitoring and assessment
- Automated response to security incidents
- Automate all chain processes needed from build to deploy your software in production

### üïµ Real-Time Visibility and Observability
- Integrated security dashboards and reporting
- Comprehensive security monitoring
- Real-time threat detection and response
- Clear visibility into security and CI/CD metrics

### üõ°Ô∏è Culture of Security Ownership
- Visibility of the project's security situation for management
- Shared responsibility for security
- Security awareness across all teams
- Regular security training and education
- Proactive security mindset

## Conslusion

The OWASP DevSecOps Maturity Model provides a structured approach to improving security practices in software development. By understanding and implementing this model, organizations can systematically enhance their security posture while maintaining development efficiency. The journey to DevSecOps maturity is continuous, requiring commitment, resources, and cultural change, but the benefits in terms of reduced risk, improved security, and enhanced operational efficiency make it a worthwhile investment.
