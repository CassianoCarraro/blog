Today, I'll share some research I've done about DevSecOps certification programs and training. This is a good subject for those interested in joining this area. I worked for many years in different areas of software development â€” full-stack development, infrastructure management, and tech lead â€” before I started working with DevSecOps practices. At that time, I was driven by function overloading to find better ways to do my work and avoid repetitive, toilsome activities. An awesome book that I read, which helped me adopt this mindset, was [The Site Reliability Workbook](https://sre.google/workbook/table-of-contents/) from the Google team â€” it's free, by the way.

In my case, I gained experience in DevSecOps practices by using them to improve my daily work in a place that was not yet practicing DevSecOps. But this may not be the reality for everyone. Maybe you don't have many opportunities to work in this area in your current job, and you want to move to a DevSecOps team or make a career transition. Another very common case is engaging your team to create or improve DevSecOps practices in your software development cycle. Considering this, some training and certifications could help you or your team reach your objectives.

## For People

There are many certification programs available that you can explore depending on your context and objectives. Some good certification programs are based on specific cloud provider technologies. Don't worry too much about the tools used â€” focus on the main concepts and practices. Once you understand the fundamentals, you can transform that specialized knowledge into a more generalist one by applying it with other tools and technologies. The concepts don't change.

These certifications are good choices for those who want formal proof of knowledge in the area. If you don't want a certification but still want to start learning, I recommend taking a preparatory course from a cloud provider. I've already taken some classes on [Google Cloud Skills Boost](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/catalog?keywords=devsecops) and [AWS Training and Certification](https://www.aws.training/LearningLibrary?query=devsecops) â€” most of these courses are free.

## For Teams

Currently, there are several maturity models that can be used to evaluate your organization's maturity and plan improvements with your team. However, these models do not issue a certificate to prove your team's DevSecOps maturity, as CMMI does for software development, for example. Therefore, you should choose a model that fits your organization's needs and encourage your team to take some of the courses and certifications listed below. But make no mistake: more important than obtaining a certificate is the ability to implement good practices in your development cycle. Some of these models are:
