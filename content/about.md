I am a Software Engineering Specialist with a strong passion for delivering scalable, secure, and high-quality solutions. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Universidade de Caxias do Sul (UCS, 2019) and a postgraduate degree in Business Management from Fundação Getulio Vargas (FGV, 2023), which provides me with a solid blend of technical expertise and business insight.

With a focus on DevSecOps methodologies, I excel at planning and implementing solutions that align with client needs while maintaining the highest standards of security, reliability, and performance.

Currently, I work at Brazil’s National Research and Education Network ([RNP](https://www.rnp.br/)), where I have the privilege of contributing to projects that positively impact the lives of people across the country.
